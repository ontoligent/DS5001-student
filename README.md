# DS5001-student

**Student work directory**

Create a repo named `DS5001-<uva-login-id>` using this as the template.

Replace `<uva-login-id>` with your UVA login ID. For example, `DS5001-rca2t`.

Make the repo private and invite the instructor and student.

Put all of your in-class notebooks and homework assignments here.

Share links with notebooks in Canvas as needed.

**In-class notebooks**

One approach to using the course notebooks during labs is just to copy them here.

So, keep an up-to-date repo of the course materials and just copy content from there to here.

Also, no need to fork the course repo. Just clone it and pull each time, being sure not to make any changes to the repo.

If you do make changes, you can call `git stash` to remove them.
